- Google Fonts caching optimization

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t student-loans-ebonder .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 student-loans-ebonder
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `pnpm build`

```text
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets (including PWA files)
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

### PWA Deployment Considerations

When deploying the PWA:

- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA features)
- Verify service worker registration
- Test offline functionality
- Validate manifest.json accessibility
- Check icon display across different devices

## Development

### Code Quality

This project includes several tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint**: Code linting with React and TypeScript rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting with import sorting
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **Vitest**: Unit testing framework
